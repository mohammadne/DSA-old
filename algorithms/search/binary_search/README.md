### Given an integer X and integers A0, A1,. . ., AN−1, which are presorted and already in memory, ﬁnd i such that Ai=X, or return i= −1 if X is not in the input.

### focus that the input would then need to be sorted once.

### the contains operation in O(log N) time, but all other operations (in particular,insert) require O(N) time

### solution_1 : O(log(N))
